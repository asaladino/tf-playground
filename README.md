# tf-playground
Just learning tensorflow.

This repo has the code for the following tutorials:
- Basic Classification
- Text Classification

## Notes
The general project structure behind tensorflow/ml/keras:
1. Gather data for training and testing.
2. Format/scale data.
3. Build a model with layers.
4. Compile the model with meta parameters.
5. Train/fit the model with training data and labels.
6. Evaluate the training of the model with test data (technically optional).
7. Use the model to make a prediction.

With tensorflow and keras, the code for each part of the project is a single line of code.
The main items the developer is responsible for are:
1. Asking the right question.
2. Gathering, formatting and labeling training and testing data.
3. Knowing what the possible layers are and how to use them.
4. Knowing the meta parameters for compiling the model and how to use them.
5. Knowing the fit parameters and how to use them.
